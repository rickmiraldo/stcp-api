# üöåüöè Unofficial STCP API - Porto (PT) buses

This software aims to create an unofficial API for STCP buses in the Porto metropolitan area.

Since there's no official API, this software relies on simple HTTP requests to an undocumented STCP endpoint, and as such, is subject to break if any major changes happens.

Also, it is subject to the same limitations as the STCP endpoint itself, for example, not displaying more than 4 buses at a time and not displaying any bus if their ETA is more than 60 minutes.

Built with .Net Core 3.

## Usage

`stop/<code>`

To get all buses from a stop, where `<code>` is the bus stop code such as CMIC1 or LION1.

`line/<number>`

To get all stops from a line, where `<number>` is the line number such as 206 or 3M.

`line/full/<number>`

To get all stops from a line and buses within those stops, where `<number>` is the line number such as 206 or 3M.
